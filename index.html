              <p>
                I am a programmer, a mother of three young adults, and a
                life-long learner. My family including my husband Leo and
                two-year old son Michael ("Misha") immigrated to the US from
                Belarus in 1996 with very little English, no money, and huge
                hopes for a better life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, I strive to seize any opportunity to expand my
                knowledge and gain new skills. Just less than a year after
                immigration, I graduated from a small technical college and was
                able to find my first full time job as Computer Programmer for
                packaging products distribution company based in Milwaukee, WI.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first job taught me so much, and my co-workers became a
                family. Together, we grew as programmers from Cobol to web
                development using JavaScript, ColdFusion, and ASP. As a team, we
                learned together how to customize Microsoft Commerce Server to
                create a fully-functioning e-commerce site for our company.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, my family grew as well, and my husband and I
                had three beautiful children. We had to move to Michigan for my
                husband's job, and my company asked me to continue working for
                them from Michigan as an independent contractor. However, at
                some point I had to choose whether to be a good programmer or a
                good mother, devoted to her children and all their activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                This year, my youngest child is leaving for college. And I
                decided to reclaim my career, and return to what I have loved
                doing the most: web development. In June, I enrolled in
                full-stack web development bootcamp at Michigan State
                University. I started learning the latest trends in web
                development including HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, Express.js, React.Js,
                Node.js, GitHub, and GitBash. It is not easy to start learning
                again at 51... But I am sure that I will persevere, and will
                become a Web Developer again!
